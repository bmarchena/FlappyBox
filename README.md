## FlappyBox ##

This is a 2D side-scrolling game originally styled after Flappy Bird. The user controls the eponymous FlappyBox by pressing spacebar to try to keep him afloat and avoid obstacles. Each obstacle that the player successfully avoids and leaves the screen will increment the player's score by 1. The game displays the highest score and record time of each play session. Avoiding obstacles for long enough will move the player to the next level, which will increase the speed of scrolling.
